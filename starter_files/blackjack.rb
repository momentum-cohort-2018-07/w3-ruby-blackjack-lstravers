puts "TO DO: Implement the game of blackjack."

# Hint: for starters, read bin/blackjack.rb

puts "\nI have no blackjack game code to add. I am working with the 'Learn Ruby the Hard Way' .pdf document. 

\nI've completed exercises 1-12 and learned so much! Ruby is actually starting to make sense now!!  

\nI wish I had tried this link and discovered this document last Monday! I lost far too much time trying different websites to learn Ruby! 
\nIf I had only known to BEGIN with this document!"

puts "\nI have the code files as proof but don't know how to upload them to my development branch. \nUPDATE: Completed exercises 13 and 14 in LRtHW."
